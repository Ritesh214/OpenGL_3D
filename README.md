<h2>How do I approach designing software?</h2>
<p><b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</b></p>
<p>Modularization. Creating modules and header files has help me to learn how to create code that can be reused in future projects</p>
<p><b>What design process did you follow for your project work?</b></p>
<p>I created header files and classes that allowed me to use and re-use code in the creation of 3D objects</p>
<p><b>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</b></p>
<p>The header files and classes can easily be reused by including them in the project e.g. #include "cylinder.h"</p>
<h2>How do I approach developing programs?</h2>
<p><b>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</b></p>
<p>.reaking up the deliverables.</br>
.Prioritize features based on immediate expectations.</br>
.Expect and plan for mistakes.</br>
.Focusing on sprints and incremental changes.</br>
.Leveraging on no-code platforms.</br>
. Using beta testing to refine and show progress.</br>
</p>
<p><b>How did iteration factor into your development?</b></p>
<p>To create a 3D scene with multiple objects I has to iterate the varios 3D objects but with a different scalling factor</p>
<p><b>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</b></p>
<p>I have learnt to create header files and classes that allow me to re-use code when necessary</p>
<h2>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</h2>
<p><b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</b></p>
<p>I have learnt to create modules and classes that I can re-use in future projects</p>
<p><b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</b></p>
<p>Understanding how a computer processes 3D objects has given me a new respect towards the use of registers and memory in the computer</p>
